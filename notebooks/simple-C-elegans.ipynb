    "This is essentially a single python script that simulates the nervous system of the C. elegans; with many caveats known to the authors.  The goal is purposeful simplicity to be able to demonstrate the concepts surrounding simulating a nervous system with a reasonable amount of biological detail.  This walkthrough will explain the simple-C-elegans code and how it works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust approach is being taken in the OpenWorm project that involves many pieces of infrastructure that are more sophisticated, but also less simple.  Therefore, in addition to explaining how this code works, the larger OpenWorm infrastructure that is responsible for various steps will also be explained along the way.\n",

    "Because of the computational cost of doing numerical integration over a large system of equations, the computational neuroscience community has coalesced around a very mature tool known simply as [NEURON](http://neuron.yale.edu).  Under the hood of the c302 framework we are using in the project, is the option to simulate using NEURON.  NEURON has highly efficient algorithms built into it to solve systems of equations in the case of branching neurons.  Even running on single nodes, a noticeable speed up can be appreciated over the performance of odeint as it is being used here.  For more details on the fundamentals of these algorithms (it involves using matrix math), check out [Hines 1984](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020710184900084).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of NEURON is that it continues to be optimised for high-performance computing.  In particular, NEURON can be run using [MPI on supercomputers](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/help/neuron/neuron/classes/parcon.html#MPI) (although models must be designed to take advantage of parallelism.. no free lunch on that), and it is reported that there is a GPU branch that will be available later this year for gaining efficiency [on single nodes with GPUs](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=3035) (reportedly not requiring special model design to see an improvement).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, when all the neurons are activated, this script slows down greatly so that it may take an hour or more to complete.  Under NEURON, this would likely only take a minute or two."

    "One main difference in this setup of the model from what we are doing over in [c302](https://github.com/openworm/CElegansNeuroML/tree/master/CElegans/pythonScripts/c302) is that the neurons themselves are not given any internal dynamics, such as would come from Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) or Potassium ($K^+$) channels, as is described in the [Hodgkin-Huxley tutorial](http://hodgkin-huxley-tutorial.readthedocs.io/).  In OpenWorm, we have engaged in the project of determining as precisely as possible all the known ion channels in C. elegans neurons and their dynamics in the [ChannelWorm project](http://github.com/openworm/ChannelWorm).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second main difference is how the multipicity of equations is managed.  Rather than use adjacency matrices like this, c302 behind the scenes will generate a [LEMS](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00079/full) [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file which will create an instance defining all the cells and each connection between them.  This can be seen in the figure below, as the boxes that are generated coming out of \"c302_X.py\".  This XML file will then get interpreted by libneuroml and get converted into the appropriate NEURON simulation code.  By adding this extra intermediate step, the entire network can be written out in a [declarative form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) -- i.e. an XML file -- that completely describes the model using domain concepts that are particular to a biological network model, rather than just systems of equations.  This is valuable as you want to be able to focus on the biological details only and not worry about the equations that will result from them until a later stage.  But, it is also more complex for a developer as you need to keep in mind a few more moving parts in your mind as you work with more abstract files.\n",
